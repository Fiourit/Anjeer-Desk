# Anjeer Desk - Python Version with DANA AI

A digital space for time, reading, and quiet attention, powered by DANA AI for thoughtful quote generation.

## Features

- **DANA AI Quote System**: Python-based AI that generates thoughtful, meaningful quotes for each day
- **No Database Required**: All quotes are generated deterministically based on day of year
- **Continuous Time Display**: Rectangular border that fades throughout the day
- **Day Counter**: Shows your position within the year (Day X of YYYY)
- **24-Hour Border Animation**: A slow-evolving border that completes one cycle every twenty-four hours
- **Daily Quote**: One thoughtful quote per day, generated by DANA AI
- **Private Notes**: A writing space stored only on your device
- **Silence Mode**: Hide quote, leaving only time and the page itself

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python + Flask
- **AI System**: DANA AI (deterministic quote generation)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Deployment**: Render.com (Python)

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd anjeer-desk
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   
   Or with gunicorn (production-like):
   ```bash
   gunicorn app:app
   ```

4. **Visit:**
   - Main page: http://localhost:5000
   - About page: http://localhost:5000/about

## DANA AI System

DANA AI is a Python-based system that generates thoughtful quotes for each day of the year. It:

- Uses day of year as a deterministic seed
- Maintains a curated pool of 365+ thoughtful quotes
- Ensures the same quote appears on the same day each year
- Requires no database - all quotes are generated algorithmically

### How It Works

1. DANA AI maintains a pool of thoughtful quotes from diverse sources
2. Each day of the year (1-365/366) gets a deterministic quote
3. The same day always shows the same quote (repeats annually)
4. No database queries needed - everything is calculated in memory

## Deployment to Render.com

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Python version with DANA AI"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Create Web Service on Render

1. Go to https://render.com
2. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - **Name:** `anjeer-desk`
   - **Environment:** `Python 3`
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Plan:** Free

5. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - `PORT`: `10000` (Render sets this automatically, but you can specify)

6. Click "Create Web Service"

### Step 3: Deploy

Render will automatically:
- Install Python dependencies
- Build your application
- Deploy it

Your site will be available at `https://anjeer-desk.onrender.com`

## Advantages of Python/DANA AI Version

1. **No Database Required**: Saves on database costs and complexity
2. **Deterministic**: Same day always shows same quote
3. **Fast**: No database queries, instant quote generation
4. **Simple**: Single Python file handles all quote logic
5. **Scalable**: Can easily expand quote pool

## Notes

- DANA AI generates quotes deterministically - the same day will always show the same quote
- Quotes are selected from a curated pool of 365+ thoughtful quotes
- The system is designed to be thoughtful and meaningful, not cheaply motivational
- All quotes include their authors
